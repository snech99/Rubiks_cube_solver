# Rubiks_cube_solver
This work was created as part of a project in my degree course in mechatronics. This code was compiled as a DLL and integrated into a LabView file. The executing robot is a self-built robot based on LEGO and the EV3 Brick.



Some example cubes are available. These can be used to determine the required input for solving the cube. 
It is important to read the cube according to a certain pattern.
The order of the sides does not matter, but the order of the bricks on each side is important.
The cube is held with the red side facing forward and the yellow side facing up. Below is a picture showing the order in which the bricks are to be read for each side.
